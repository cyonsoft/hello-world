# hello-world

Hey guys,

# Frank here. I am a new starter in Python study. I am a poor guy, so I have to pick up by self-study. I hope scripting could change my life, not only for the meal, but also for the lifestyle and hobbies.  

# I have taken some basic knowledge about Python. Now I am self-studying the web scraping. I am still outsider. Hoping I could make friends, and mentors here.

# Wish the world is peaceful, the Corona-virus will leave soon, and every people in harmony.

# I love this world. I hope I could change it. --- At least, my world!

# 'Frank Chen'

# Below is my today's script.
